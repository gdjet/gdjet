admin:
	* all admin thingies. since we want to make it very customizable which admin thingies
	are really loaded, we may introduce some way in settings to override which models get
	loaded into admin. since django introspection has to work, this wont work for models 
	i suppose.
	* all admin forms have to register in subfiles, not in init.

forms:
	* all formextensions come here in an own file.
	forms.widgets: load all widgets of your stuff here.
	forms.fields: load all your fields here
	
	so this works:
	from gdjet.forms import *
	
	or also this:
	from gdjet.forms.widgets import stuff.

urls:
	* "admin.py": here all admin urls.
	* else: there all other urls.

models:
	* create models in subfiles.
	* for introspection, they have to be loaded in init. do they?
	* abstract models, model mixins etc. are not loaded in init.
	* proxy objects can reference their original and still reside in another file! cool!

templatetags:
	* group functions together please.

templates:
	* use subdirectories. try not to overwrite stuff in other things.
	* monkey/ subdirectory for template opt-ins. e.g. admin_site.html
	* monkey/examples/ for how to integrate that stuff.
