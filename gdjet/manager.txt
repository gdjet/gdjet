Manager
=======

The Manager consists of tools to manage global variables in your project in the
database

Plans:
	:)	Saveable Variables (String, Text, Boolean) per Module
	:(	Saveable Structs either as JSON or PHPSerialize.
	:(	Management interface
	:(	Genesis integration
	:(	Loading technique which loads data into memory, to save database access.
	
1. Saveable Variables

2. Saveable Structs

3. Management Interface
ManagerModule.admin offers custom views for every module, to set and retrieve
variables.

4. Genesis
Manager management.py should be created with every genesis project.

5. Loading Tech
by defining a lockfile (/tmp/gdjet.????.lock) which is touched by the loaders
upon saving data into the database, data is only loaded from database if access
has been done since touchfile time was remembered.

Upon first load every instance recreates the file, but then it is maintained
by remembering the last date the file has.

The whole loading cache technique maybe becomes a submodule.
